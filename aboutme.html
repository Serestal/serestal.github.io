					Hello! My name is Alice and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at Cornell University. For most of my life I went by my legal name, Ge, but after having to correct people so many times, I decided that college was the perfect opportunity to choose a different name. New life, new people, new opportunities, right?
					<br><br>
					I'm 5 feet short, have a pet parrot, and love drinking tea. My Chinese name, Ge, means "song", and I actually really love music. I started my first instrument, piano, in second grade and since then, I've played the violin, flute, Chinese zither, guitar, and ukelele. Yes, I do listen to classical music (Dvorak, Mahler, Chopin!!!), but I listen to pop songs most of the time. My favorite artists change frequently, and right now I have a Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran obsession. Besides music, I also love drawing and making videos. Please check out my gallery!
					<br><br>
					I started my journey at Cornell thinking that I was going to be a Mechanical Engineer because I loved physics. However, I switched to computer science after really loving my Matlab programming course and realizing that what I really loved was problem solving. So now I'm in my third semester of computer science. My favorite computer science classes thus far have been Algorithms and Networks. I loved learning about how individual actions affect group decisions in Networks, and I love the "Ah-ha!" moment when you finally understand why a seemingly convoluted algorithm works.
